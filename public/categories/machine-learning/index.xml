Alongside this, they have often be the winning models in many Kaggle competitions. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the most popular of these models: XGBoost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;XGBoost popularity stems from many reasons, with the most important being its scalability to all scenarios. It is one of the fastest tree based models to train because of the algorithms used with sparse data and it&amp;rsquo;s exploitation of parallel and distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One key application of ML in medicine is biomedical image processing. These types of models takes an image as an input and then assigns a class label to each pixel in a process called localisation. Competitions are held annually to advance these ML models for biomedical image processing tasks. For instance, the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) hosts yearly competitions focused on various biomedical imaging challenges. One notable problems from the ISBI involves segmenting neuronal structures in electron microscopy stacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While neural networks (NNs) have been used in this context, they have historically struggled to match the performance of tree-based methods. Despite recent advancements in NN capabilities and their success in tasks from computer vision, language translation, and image generation, tree-based algorithms still outperform neural networks when it comes to tabular data. This article will introduce several reasons behind the continued dominance of tree-based methods in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
