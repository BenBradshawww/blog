Since he has one a one too many drinks he can&amp;rsquo;t walk well and they now has 1/3 probability to walk off the edge of the cliff or 2/3 probability to take a step backwards. What is the probability that he will eventually fall off the edge of the cliff?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.mathstoml.com/images/sq-lim-aWm7fAUNPEc-unsplash.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@sql&#34;&gt;Image by sq lim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s article will look at one of the more difficult areas in probability called martingale theory. We will cover the basic theory and look at 2 examples which use martingale theory (the drunk man and the ABRACADABRA problem).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-theory&#34;&gt;The Theory&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into the problem, we have to cover some of the theory behind martingales. It is important to mention we will be skipping over many of the measure theory definitions and theorems. These will be covered at a later time. If you wish to read up more about this area of mathematics, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend reading the paper by T. Smith &lt;a href=&#34;https://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2012/REUPapers/Smith.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This paper was the basis for this article [1].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It moves with the speed of 10cm per second, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know where to go, therefore every second it moves randomly 10cm directly north, south, east or west with equal probability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) If the food is located on east-west lines 20cm to the north and 20cm to the south, as well as on north-south lines 20cm to the east and 20cm to the west from the anthill, how long will it take the ant to reach it on average?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
