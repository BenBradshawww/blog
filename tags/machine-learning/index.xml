Alongside this, they have often be the winning models in many Kaggle competitions. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the most popular of these models: XGBoost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;XGBoost popularity stems from many reasons, with the most important being its scalability to all scenarios. It is one of the fastest tree based models to train because of the algorithms used with sparse data and it&amp;rsquo;s exploitation of parallel and distributed computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This formula is used in the background of many of the modern day machine learning models focused around probabilistic modelling. These including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Models, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Additionally, this article will cover some of KL divergence&amp;rsquo;s key properties and briefly cover one of its applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

While neural networks (NNs) have been used in this context, they have historically struggled to match the performance of tree-based methods. Despite recent advancements in NN capabilities and their success in tasks from computer vision, language translation, and image generation, tree-based algorithms still outperform neural networks when it comes to tabular data. This article will introduce several reasons behind the continued dominance of tree-based methods in this domain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
