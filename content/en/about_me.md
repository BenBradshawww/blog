# About Me


Hi, Iâ€™m Ben, a Foundation ML Engineer based in London, currently working at the startup Pharmovo where we apply AI solutions to forecast the demand of pharmacetutical drugs in the US and UK.

Prior to this role, I worked as a data scientist at the start up Eligible where we applied data driven approaches to predict the actions of mortgage users. My final work experience was at NatWest Markets where I applied ML methods to determine whether bonds were over or under priced within a portfolio.

I created this platform to share my research and insights in these areas and to connect with others who share similar interests.
