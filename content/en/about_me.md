# About Me


Hi, Iâ€™m Ben, a Founding ML Engineer based in London. I currently work at Pharmovo, a startup where we leverage AI to forecast the demand for pharmaceutical drugs in the US and UK.

Before this, I was a data scientist at Eligible, a startup focused on using data-driven approaches to predict the actions of mortgage users. Prior to that, I worked at NatWest Markets, applying machine learning techniques to assess whether bonds within a portfolio were over- or under-priced.

I created this platform to share my research, insights, and experiences in these fields while connecting with others who share similar interests.
